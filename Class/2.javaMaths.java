    Java Maths:
         In java, the Math class is a built-in class that is part of java.lang package. It provides a collection of static methods for performing common mathematical operations. The Math class allows us to perform arithemetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, rounding and other mathemetical calculation.  
    

    1> Arithemetic:
        > `int addExact(int a, int b)` : Adds two integers, throwing an exception on overflow.
        > `int substractExact(int x, int y)`: Subtracts two integer, throw an exception on overflow.
        > `int multiplyExact(int a, int b)` : Multiplies two integer, throw an exception on overflow.
        > `int increment Exact(int x)`: Increment an integer by 1.
        > `int decrementExact(int x)`: Decrement an integer by 1.
        > Math.max(x,y): this method is used for find the highest value of x and y.
        > Math.min(x,y): this method is used for find the lowest value of x and y.
        > Math.sqrt(x): this method is used for return the squre root of x.

    2> Exponents and Logarithms:
        > `double pow(double base, double exponent) : Raise a number to a power.
        > `double sqrt(double x)`: Calculates the square root.
        > `double cbrt (double x): Calculate cube root.
        > `double log(double x)` :Calculate the natural logarithm (base e).
        
    3> Trigonometric Function:
        > double sin(double radians), double cos (double radians), double atan(double radians) : computes the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle given in radians.
    
    4> Rounding and Floor/Ceiling:
        >long round(double x) Rounds a floating point number to the rearest long integer.
        >double floor (double x): Returns the largest integer less then or equal to the argument.
        >double ceil(double x): Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument.
        
    Java Boolean: In java, boolean is a primitive data type representing a binary value that can have one of two possitive values:  true or false. the boolean data type is use to express logicqal conditions, make decisions and control the flow of a program.
        > Logical Operators: boolean data types are primarily used in conjunction with logical operators to create conditional expressions.
        > '&&' logical AND
        > '||' logical OR
        > '!'  logical NOT
