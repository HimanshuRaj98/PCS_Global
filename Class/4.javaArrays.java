    Java Array : In java, and array is a data structure that allows us to store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same data type. It provide an effecient way to manage and access multiple elements with a single variable. Each element in an array is accessed by its index, starting from for first element, 1 for the second element, and so on.

    Array Declaration: dataType [] arrayName; -> To declear an array, we need to specify the data type of the elements and use square brackets [] to indicate that it is an array.
    
    Accessing Array Elements: Array elements are accessed using their index, which starts from 0 and goes up to length - 1, where length is the total number of the elements in the array.
    
    Example:        String[] cars = {"maruti", "volvo", "ford"};
                    int[] num = {21,54,84};
                    String selectedCar = cars[1];
    
    Array Length: The length of an array is determined by the number of the elements it contains. We can get the length of an array using the length attribute.
    
    Example:        //Array Length
                    int arrayLength = cars.length;
                    System.out.println(cars.length);
    
    Iterating througn an array: We can use loops (such as for loop or for-each loop) to iterate through the elements of an array.
    
    Example:
    for-each loop: for-each loop is also used to loop through elements in array.
    
            Syntax: for (dataType variable: arrayname) {
            //code to be executed
            }

    Multi-dimensional Array: 

    In java, a multi-dimensional array is an array of arrays, meaning it is an array where each element is also an array. This allows us to create arrays with multiple dimensions, such as 2D arrays or even higher-dimensional arrays.Multi-dimensional arrays are useful for representing data in a matrix-like structure.
    To create a two-dimensional array, each array within its own set of curly braces.

    Example: 
            //create two dimensional array.
            int[][] myNumber = {{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8}};
            //Access the elements.
            int a myNumber [1] [2];
            System.out.println(a);

    Java methods: 

    A method is a block of code which only runs when it called. We can pass data, known as parameters, into a method. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also
    known as functions.

    Create a Methods: 
    A method must be decleared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). Java provides some pre-defined methods such as System.out.println(), but we can also create our own methods to perform certain actions.

    Method Parameters: Information can be passed to methods as parameters. Parameters act as variables inside the methods.


    Java Recursion: Recursion is the technique to makeing a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

    Examples: 
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int result = sum(3);
            System.out.println(result);
        } I
        public static int sum(int k) {
            if (k > 0) {
                return k + sum(k-1);
            }else 
                return 0;
        }
